## Description

This assignment demonstrates key Python skills using the `datetime`, `timedelta`, and `relativedelta` modules, along with basic file input simulation and custom function writing.

The goal was to revise and expand upon the professor's original snippets using modern Python 3 practices while keeping the logic clear and screenshot-ready.

##  What This Script Covers

###  Step 1
Simulates tab-separated input using a list and processes each row. Outputs the item and cost.

###  Step 2
Uses `datetime.now()` and performs the following:
- Adds 1 day
- Subtracts 60 seconds
- Adds 2 years

###  Step 3
Creates a `timedelta` representing:
- 100 days, 10 hours, and 13 minutes  
Includes both a long-form and simplified version.

###  Step 4
Defines a function that takes two arguments (feet and inches) and prints them along with the current timestamp and data type of the time object.
